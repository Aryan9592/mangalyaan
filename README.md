# mangalyaan
Mangalyaan is a storytelling website for the Spacecraft 'Mangalyaan' that was sent to mars by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation).
This website is my personal project.
I had created this website for a website design competition held in my institute.
Project is made frontend and is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
